# LinqAndXmlTest
Studying project for learning XML x LINQ. I made two projects, with WinForms apps with list of products including different sorts and
filters. NoLinqToXmlExample proj - makes all sorts and filters without using LINQ, LinqToXmlExamole proj uses LINQ.

My personal conclusion is that linq is kind of powerful tool, which allows you to simplify your code, make it easier to read ( as you can
see NoLinq proj form1.cs file has 337 code lines when File with Linq includes only 218 code lines).
But I am not taking app productivity into a count
